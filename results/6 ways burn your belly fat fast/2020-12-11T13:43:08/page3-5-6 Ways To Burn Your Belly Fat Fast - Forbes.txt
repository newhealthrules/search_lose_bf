6 Ways To Burn Your Belly Fat Fast

Sleep. If you want to work late at night, think again.
Short bursts of exercises. 1000 crunches a night may get you strong abdominal muscles, but with a full layer of fat on top, you will not get the results you really want.
Sugar is your Enemy. Fighting belly fat is 80% healthy diet.
Vitamin C. When you're under extreme stress, you secrete more cortisol hormone.
Eat Fat. Yup, you heard me! It takes fat to burn fat.
Slowing down your breath. This is a very simple method that you can use even when you're in the midst of doing something else.
